1) Solve any 8 out of 10 in 1.30 hr ( 5marks each)


Q.1) Write a Java program to find common elements between two integer arrays.
Q.2). Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of an array.
q.3).  Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements.
q.4)Write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value.
q.5) Write a Java program to find duplicate elements in an array.
q.6)Write a Java program to test two arrays' equality (both 1-D and 2D array)
q.7)find the missing element in integer array of 1 to 7?
      int ar [] = new int[]{1,2,3,5,6,7};
hint:
     Algorithm
      1)Get the sum of numbers
      2) total = n*(n+1)/2
      3) Subtract all the numbers from sum and
you will get the missing number.
4)According to below logic sumOfNnumberss is 7*(7+1)/2=28
5)sumOfElements = 1+2+3+5+6+7=24 missing element is = 28-24=4

q.8)	Write a Java program to find all pairs of elements in Java array whose sum is equal to a given number
 Input: 15 12 4 16 9 8 24 0 24 
Output: (15,9), (16,8),(24,0)

q.9)	Write a Java program to find sum of all elements in an array.
q.10)  Write a Java program to find row wise sum, column wisesum in 2-d array ?
